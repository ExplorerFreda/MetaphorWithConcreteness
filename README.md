# MetaphorWithConcreteness

This project is the duplication of Paper Literal and metaphorical sense identification through concrete and abstract context (Turney et al., 2011) and other experiments about metaphor and concreteness. 
Since the data is too large, I didn't upload it. If you are interested in the experiments, please see <a href="http://nparc.cisti-icist.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/view/object/?id=1152ebbb-654f-4e3a-8ace-7d41c209a34c">here</a>.
